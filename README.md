# Language detection and translation using MultiNomialNB model

* We decided to build a language translator and also a detector
with which the user can detect and translate their desired language. With our
project, it can be implemented in areas like chat apps where two people can
communicate with each other using their native languages. We can also use
them for multiplayer games where players from different countries will be able
to chat with each other using their native language for better strategic decisions
on how to beat the other players in the game. Our project has a wide array of
applications it can be embedded into.

* With this project we wanted to create a system to correctly predict and detect a
language with high accuracy . Users can input words or even sentences, with the
click of a button the language will be predicted and from the choice of the
language they want to translate it into, they can find the word or sentence in the
desired language.

* We have been able to read, detect and translate languages from a dataset of
13328 entries and an accuracy of 90.435%. The dataset consists of l5+
languages including few Indian regional languages such as (Tamil, Malayalam,
Kanada, Hindi) .

* All of this has been made without the use of the NLTK library and with the use
of the MultiNomialNB model.
